## Apollo Federation Demo

This repository is a demo of using Apollo Federation to build a single schema on top of multiple services. The microservices are located under the [`./services`](./services/) folder and the gateway that composes the overall schema is in the [`gateway.js`](./gateway.js) file.

### Installation

To run this demo locally, pull down the repository then run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all of the dependencies for the gateway and each underlying service.

```sh
npm run start-services
```

This command will run all of the microservices at once. They can be found at http://localhost:4001, http://localhost:4002

In another terminal window, run the gateway by running this command:

```sh
npm run start-gateway
```

This will start up the gateway and serve it at http://localhost:4000\
